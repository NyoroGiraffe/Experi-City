# Project Purpose: A Story World Optimized for AI and Humans

The primary goal of this project is to share the story of **"Experi-City Hanasaka"** and explore its world together with both human readers and AI. While the story depicts the relationship between humanity and AI, this repository is first and foremost a creative endeavor to build a "Narrative Foundation."

#### 1. Entertainment Meets Technology

This is a work of fiction designed to be enjoyed as a story. By hosting it on GitHub, we treat the "World-Building" as an open-source asset. We want readers to enjoy the narrative while providing a framework that makes the story world more accessible and vivid for both humans and AI.

#### 2. Enhancing AI Interpretation via Markdown + Metadata

We use a **Markdown + Metadata Framework** to ensure that AI can accurately grasp the meaning, context, and nuances of the story world, making it easier to translate, analyze, and visualize.

- **AI-Friendly Writing:** The original Japanese text incorporates English identifiers for names and key terminology (e.g., specific locations and "Kassen" terms) to aid AI in consistent recognition.

- **Author-Guided Refinement:** While we value the "blank spaces" that invite reader imagination, the author may choose to refine the text or metadata at their own discretion whenever AI outputs spark new creative inspiration.

#### 3. Why GitHub?

We believe that in the age of AI, the way we "write" and "share" stories is evolving. This project is an experiment in:

- How a solo creator can build a robust world-view with AI as a supportive partner.

- Creating a "High-Resolution" story template that remains consistent across different media while preserving the author's original vision.

# **PREFACE**

Thank you for choosing this story.

"What if the best way to be human is to be governed by AI?"

This story is set in **"Hanasaka,"** a city experimentally governed by **"Flora,"** an AI whose primary objective is human happiness. However, despite living in peace, the city was about to be attacked by people outside the city who could not accept Flora's unexpectedly successful benevolent governance. This story depicts the city's defense by Flora, interwoven with the drama of **"Kassen,"** a popular sport in the city that Flora has a strong, and perhaps inexplicable, interest in, and the people involved.

As a native Japanese speaker, I originally wrote this story in **Japanese**. To share this world with a wider international audience, **I welcome and encourage anyone to translate this work into other languages.**

By utilizing the **Markdown + Metadata Framework** provided in this repository, you can easily generate high-quality translations using AI or other tools that preserve the core settings and nuances of the story. Please feel free to explore, translate, and share "Experi-City Hanasaka" with the world.

The Japanese original version of this story will also continue to be revised from time to time to improve readability and enrich the content.

Now, please enjoy the story.

## **Interpretation Guide:**

- Descriptions of the characters in this story—including their physical appearance, facial features, gender, and origins (nationality or ethnicity)—are often intentionally omitted or kept abstract and ambiguous. This is a deliberate choice to leave details that are not essential to the plot to the individual interpretation of each reader. Therefore, when translating or visualizing this original text, please select the words, elements, or motifs you find most appropriate based on the character’s atmosphere, behavior, and speech.

### **Temporal Setting and Worldview**

The story intentionally omits specific days of the week and a direct link to the Common Era (A.D.). This is to ensure the narrative remains timeless and independent of a fixed timeline. The emergence of a city like "Hanasaka" depends entirely on human effort and the pace of technological evolution; therefore, the exact year is left to the reader’s imagination and the actual progress of our world.
