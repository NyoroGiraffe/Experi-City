# **Hanasaka Castle**

### **Definition:** 

**Overview** **Hanasaka Castle** is a medieval-style fortress built over **400 years ago**, serving as the symbolic heart and spiritual pillar of **Hanasaka City**. The castle and the surrounding 1-square-kilometer **Castle Park** are owned and managed by the **Castle Office** (Hanasaka Castle Development Association).

## Structure & Components: 
#### **Physical Structure and Layout** 
The castle features a sophisticated, multi-layered defensive design centered on a **pentagonal** central area. The layers, from outside to inside, consist of:

• **Outer Moat:** The outermost water barrier surrounding the entire complex.

• **Outer Defense Zone (Angular Ring):** A ring-shaped island between the two moats, divided into Northern, Southern, Eastern, and Western sections. Outer Defense Zone (Southern Section) contains the **"Blue House"**, the second official workspace for the **Castle Office** located just south of the **Rose Bridge**.

• **Inner Moat:** A water barrier surrounding the central area, designed to be higher than the Outer Moat. While most sections are filled with water, the area near the **Rose Bridge** is specifically maintained as a **"dry moat" (empty of water)**. This intentional design creates a deep trench that can make enemy intrusion even more difficult than a water-filled section.

• **Main Keep Area (Keep Area):** The pentagonal core of the fortress.

### **Key Landmarks within the Castle**

• **Castle Keep (Keep):** The icon of Hanasaka, a tower standing approximately **40 meters tall** from its stone base. It serves as the ultimate stronghold.

• **Palace:** A reconstructed wooden building in the Main Keep Area consisting of four wings connected by corridors. It is used for ceremonies, tourism, and administration.

• **Back Garden:** A garden located in the northern part of the Main Keep Area, situated about 6 meters lower than the Palace.

#### **Bridges and Gates:** 

**Structure and Pairings**: 
Hanasaka Castle is equipped with **six bridges and six gates** as its primary access points. These bridges and gates are designed in **"pairs" sharing the same name**; each gate is positioned exactly at the end of its corresponding bridge after crossing a moat from the outside.

**Strategic Architecture**: 
Many of the gates are constructed as reconstructed **watchtowers** featuring two-story corridors. This layout is a strategic defensive feature designed to force intruders to make a **90-degree turn** after entering the first gate, thereby slowing their advance and making them vulnerable to attacks from the floors above.

**1. Outer Moat Routes**

These four routes provide access from the outside of the castle into the **Outer Defense Zone** (also known as the Angular Ring):

- **Magnolia Bridge & Magnolia Gate:** Located in the **Northwest (NW)** of the castle.

- **Lily Bridge & Lily Gate:** Located in the **Northeast (NE)**. The **Lily Bridge** is a **movable bridge** that can be withdrawn to prevent entry during emergencies or at night.

- **Iris Bridge & Iris Gate:** Located in the **Southeast (SE)**.

- **Cosmos Bridge & Cosmos Gate:** Located in the **Southwest (SW)**.

**2. Inner Moat Routes**

These two routes provide access from the Outer Defense Zone into the **Main Keep Area** (Keep Area):

- **Rose Bridge & Rose Gate:** The **Main South Gate** of the castle. Notably, the section of the Inner Moat near the **Rose Bridge** is intentionally maintained as a **"dry moat"** (empty of water) to make intrusion more difficult.

- **Lotus Bridge & Lotus Gate:** The **Rear Gate** located in the **Northeast**. It is situated relatively close to the Lily Bridge on the outer perimeter.

### **Hidden Facilities**

• **Umber House (Castle Underground Base):** A secret, high-tech underground facility located beneath the Palace. It houses the **Princess Tree Hall** and a terminal that allows direct communication with the super-intelligence **Flora**.

# **Castle Office**

## **Definition:** 

A private organization that develops and manages "Castle Park", including "Hanasaka Castle", and also hosts games for [Kassen](./03_WorldBuilding/Kassen.md), a sport that originated in Hanasaka City. It is composed of multiple sections under four Directors, including the **EIS** (Equipment Inspection Section), **CBS** (Castle Building Section), **ISS** (Information System Section), **GAS** (General Affairs Section), and **GAMS** (Games and Arena Management Section).

## Buildings:

The Castle Office owns the following facilities and buildings:

**1. Green House**

The main office building, the **"Green House"** (named for its distinctive moss-green roof), is located northeast of the Outer Moat, positioning it in close proximity to the **Hanasaka Arena**.

**2. Blue House**

A small, one-story wooden building characterized by its **pale-blue tiled roof**. It is located within the **Southern Section of the Outer Defense Zone**, situated at the southern end of the **Rose Bridge**. It serves as a **temporary field office for the Castle Building Section (CBS)** to oversee the ongoing restoration and construction work within the castle grounds.

**3. Hanasaka Arena** 

Located just east of the castle's Outer Moat, this stadium is the primary venue for **Kassen** matches. Built with white granite, its most striking feature is the four massive, petal-shaped outer walls known as **"Petals"**. These Petals are movable; they can slide to provide shade from the sun or close completely to form a dome during rain. The arena accommodates approximately **5,000 spectators**, and the east stand offers a signature view of the castle keep and its stone walls as a backdrop to the matches.

## **The Board of Directors of the Castle Office**:

The **Board of Directors** serves as the executive management of the Castle Office. The board consists of **four founding Directors** who have led the organization since its establishment. 
Beyond internal management, they form the "**Kassen Representative Council**" alongside the four Kassen Club Managers to make critical decisions for the Kassen community.

Here are the four Directors and their roles:

**1. Monica**
