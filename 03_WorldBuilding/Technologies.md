# Technologies

This story features a variety of objects and items created with advanced technology.

---
# Gadgets and Small Items:

## **1. Nexus Unit**:

An information terminal carried by almost everyone, used to communicate with various city systems and exchange information. It is often referred to simply as "**Nexus**." 
The terminal has no screen; instead, it links with smart glasses and is operated through an augmented reality view displayed in front of the user’s eyes.
Citizens of the [Experimental Cities](./ExperimentalCities.md) use Nexus Units provided by the city, and the use of any units not authorized by the city is prohibited.
During [Kassen](./Kassen.md), specialized Nexus Units are used to track and record a Fighter's **Hit Points (HP)**.

## **2. Enhancers**:

**Enhancers** are external human reinforcement devices. These devices allow for the mechanical adjustment and reinforcement of human sensory organs, arms, and legs. 

### Sensory and Facial Enhancers:

**1. Smart Glasses**

A near-universal device worn by everyone except young children, regardless of their visual acuity. They overlay a wide range of information onto the real world via an **AR view**. The devices often include bone conduction audio components for communication.
They are often simply referred to as "Glasses." 

**2. Smart Goggles**

Used as an alternative to glasses during intense physical movement or when a wider field of vision and more data are required. These are standard equipment for **Kassen Fighters** during matches.

**3. Air Enhancer**

A small device attached to the tip of the nose that extends it by about two centimeters. It features an extremely thin, breathable membrane that blocks harmful floating substances and allows users to adjust their olfactory sensitivity. Many users wear them continuously, even while sleeping or bathing.

### Physical and Mobility Enhancers:

**1. Foot Enhancers (Enhancer Shoes)** 

Specialized footwear used by Kassen Fighters, designed like split-toe socks to significantly increase jumping power. While they expand a Fighter's dynamic range, they can also place significant strain on the knees and hips upon landing.

**2. Leg Enhancer** 

Mobility devices used to assist walking or compensate for limb loss. Users like **Resilin** may also use them in conjunction with motorized unicycles that are adjusted to their specific limb structure.

**3. Arm Enhancer** 

Mechanical reinforcements for the arms. **Captain Soa** utilizes an Arm Enhancer due to a previous combat injury. While it provides superior strength and grip, its use for direct combat during Kassen matches is strictly prohibited by regulations.

**4. Smart Gloves** 

Specialized gloves that assist the user in performing precise hand movements. During the Hanasaka defense, they provided AI-assisted aiming for those using ranged weapons.

**５. Exoskeleton** 

Reinforcement frameworks worn on the arms, back, and legs to augment muscular strength. 

## **3. Facial Disguise**:

A thin film applied over the face to alter a person’s appearance for the purpose of disguise.

## **4. Micro-chips**:

Identification and management chips embedded in the base of the thumb and index finger of all citizens over the age of 18. They are essential for accessing municipal services, health management, and safety systems managed by **Flora** in the Experimental Cities.

## **5. Nano-machines**:

 **Nano-machines** are microscopic internal devices that humans take into their bodies to **mechanically adjust and reinforce physical and mental functions**. Unlike "Enhancers" which are worn externally, nano-machines operate from within to manage a person’s well-being and performance.

**Examples of Proper Use (Legitimate)**

• **Medical and Mental Care:** In a regulated society, they are used to **balance neurotransmitters** in the brain to treat mental health conditions or to adjust bodily settings for both "typical" and "atypical" individuals.

• **Informed Clinical Treatment:** Legitimate use requires **full explanation by a doctor and the explicit consent** of the individual. They can be used to monitor health or counteract the effects of harmful substances.

**Examples of Misuse (Abuse)**

• **Non-consensual Injection:** Taking or injecting nano-machines into someone’s body without their consent is a **major crime**.

• **Biological Sabotage:** Hostile forces have attempted to use "bad" nano-machines to **incapacitate key individuals**, such as Kassen Fighters, by inducing extreme lethargy, altering their personality, or even causing death.

• **Deceptive Delivery:** Malicious nano-machines can be **disguised in everyday products**, such as bottled mineral water, to bypass a person's vigilance and infiltrate their system.

• **Stealth and Self-Destruction:** Advanced malicious versions can **disguise themselves as normal cells** to avoid detection by medical systems or trigger self-destructive behavior in the host.

# Robots (Mech-animals):

**Mech-animals** are robots designed after animals, insects, and birds, serving various roles in sports, daily life, and warfare.

### **Land-Based Mech-Animals**

- **Mech-horse:** Modeled after a donkey, it is used for general transportation by police and citizens. In Kassen matches, it is the primary mount for Ranked Fighters and Bow Fighters, with speed capped at 4 m/s for safety, though it can reach 40 km/h in other situations.
	- **Dragon Horse:** A specialized, high-spec mech-horse with gold and silver scales used exclusively by the Unifier.

- **Mech-dog:** A highly adaptable security and combat robot used for city-wide surveillance. They are often equipped with side-mounted firearms and possess speech functions to communicate with humans, allowing them to issue warnings or provide assistance. Additionally, they serve as specialized combat targets in the Kassen Grand Prix.

- **Mech-giraffe:** A specialized robot standing approximately 3 meters tall that serves as a **Kassen umpire**. Positioned outside the sidelines, they monitor fouls and communicate with fighters using speech functions.

### **Aerial Mech-Animals**

- **Mech-dragonfly:** A small flying robot (approx. 0.1g) used as an aerial umpire in Kassen to provide 360-degree coverage. They also function as city-wide surveillance units and wireless relays.

- **Mech-hawk:** A large bird-like robot with a 2-meter wingspan used for long-range surveillance and tracking. Hostile forces used them as self-destructing arson tools to destroy the Castle Keep, while the city uses them to body-slam intruders with flammable or incapacitating liquids.

### **Micro and Insect-Type Mech-Animals**

- **Mech-roach:** A thin, cockroach-like robot used for **eavesdropping and scouting** in narrow spaces.

- **Mech-bee:** An **attack robot** that injects toxins, anesthetics, or malicious nano-machines via a needle. They can also attach flammable liquids to targets.

- **Mech-fly:** A multi-purpose hybrid weighing roughly 0.1g that combines the scouting and attacking functions of the roach and bee.
