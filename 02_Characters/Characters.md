      - **View on Kasga:** While he respects her as an artist, he is critical of her role as the **Unifier**.

# Interpretation Guide

## General Note on Interpretation 

For any items that are not explicitly stated above, the details have been intentionally left undefined. Please interpret these aspects based on the character’s actions, behavior, and speech as described in the text.

## Akio
### **Speech Pattern:** 
 Stuttering / Stammering 
#### **Translation Directive:** 
Akio speaks with a distinct stutter. In Japanese, this is represented by repeated sounds (e.g., 「あ、あ、あの」) and frequent punctuation. **When translating into English, please replicate this stammering style.** Use repeated letters or syllables and hyphens (e.g., "I-I-I," "W-w-what," "It... it's...") to convey his speech impediment naturally in English.

## Keiko (Kagero and Lerhi)
### **Speech Pattern:** 
Kansai Dialect (Kansai-ben) 
#### **Author's Intent:** 
Keiko speaks in the Kansai dialect to represent her identity as a linguistic minority living vibrantly within the community. 
#### **Translation Directive:** 
Keiko speaks in the Kansai dialect. It is important to note that for Kansai speakers, this dialect is not merely "casual" or "slang"—it can be polite, soft, and respectful depending on the listener.
 1. **Core Translation:** Basically, translate her speech into standard English, maintaining the same level of politeness as other characters (especially when she speaks to superiors). Avoid overusing forced contractions (like "gonna") just to sound "casual." 
2. **Nuance Injection:** Where appropriate, and without breaking her politeness, try to select words that convey her inherent energy, frankness, or humor. If there are multiple ways to say something politely, choose the one that feels more vibrant or spirited. 
3. **The Goal:** The goal is to reflect her identity as a linguistic minority through her "tone of voice" and "spirit," rather than through a regional accent or broken grammar. 

## Chammei and other Non-Moto-natives
### Speech  pattern:
In this story, dialogue spoken by characters who are not **'Moto natives'** (such as **Chammei**) without the aid of **automatic translation** is sometimes intentionally written as **awkward and grammatically incomplete**. When translating these lines, please consider reflecting that **hesitancy and lack of fluency** in your rendering.


## **Translation Directive: Nicknames and Honorifics (-chan and -kun)**

In the original Japanese text, specific honorifics are used between the main characters to express deep friendship or their history as childhood classmates. **Kasga calls Keiko "Kei-chan,"** and **Keiko calls Chammei "Mei-chan,"** reflecting their close bonds. Furthermore, **Keiko calls Akio "Aki-kun,"** while **Akio calls Keiko "Kei-chan,"** terms they have used since their time as **elementary school classmates**.

**Nuance and Context:**

- **-chan:** An informal suffix used to express **affection, endearment, and closeness**. While typically used for children or female friends, Akio’s use of it for Keiko signifies their **long-standing personal history** despite the strict professional boundaries of Kassen.

- **-kun:** A suffix often used for boys or among peers. Keiko’s use of **"Aki-kun"** emphasizes their relationship as **former classmates** and her enduring fondness for him since childhood.

**Translation Policy:** The rendering of these nicknames and honorifics is left to the **translator's discretion**. You may choose from the following approaches based on the desired cultural tone:

1. **Retention of Japanese Suffixes:** Keep the original forms (e.g., **"Aki-kun," "Kei-chan," "Mei-chan"**) to preserve the authentic Japanese atmosphere and the specific linguistic layers of their relationships.

2. **English Adaptation:** Use the shortened names alone (e.g., **"Aki," "Kei," "Mei"**) or other English-style endearments if you believe it better conveys the sense of **intimacy and familiarity** to an English-speaking reader.

Please select the approach you find most appropriate based on the **character’s atmosphere, behavior, and the flow of the dialogue**.

## **Guideline on Kinship Terms (Honorifics for Siblings):**

In the original Japanese text, characters often address their older siblings using familial titles like **"Onee-chan" (お姉ちゃん / older sister)** or **"Onii-chan" (お兄ちゃん / older brother)**. For example, Kasga calls Haruna "Onee-chan," and Keiko calls Kagero "Onii-chan."

**Instruction for Translators:**

- **Flexibility of Choice:** You may choose how to render these terms based on the linguistic and cultural norms of the target language.
    
- **Option A (Naturalization):** If addressing a sibling by a familial title feels unnatural in your target language (as is common in English), you are encouraged to replace these with the siblings' **first names** (e.g., Haruna, Kagero) to maintain a natural conversational flow.
    
- **Option B (Retention of Nuance):** If your target language has equivalent affectionate terms for older siblings, or if you wish to preserve the Japanese cultural nuance, you may use appropriate honorifics or titles.

The priority is to ensure the relationship's closeness and the dialogue's naturalness are preserved for the target audience.
